Php kodu xampp serverında çalışacaktır ancak github pages server side tarafını desteklemiyor.

Github Pages does not support server side programs, which means it does not make sense to make a POST request to a URL hosted there. Consequently, you will get a Method Not Allowed error if you try to make a POST request to a Github Pages URL.(use XAMPP)

Even though my final project has come to an end for now, I will continue to.. , stay tuned
